    What is Lorem Ipsum?

*Lorem Ipsum*is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions 
of Lorem Ipsum.


    Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of 
using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of 
letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it 
look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web 
page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a 
search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their 
infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by 
accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
